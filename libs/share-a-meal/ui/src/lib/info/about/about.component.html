      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
        Share-A-Meal is a project aimed at reducing food waste and helping those in need. Our platform connects restaurants and grocery stores with local charities and food banks to donate excess food that would otherwise go to waste. By doing so, we hope to make a positive impact on both the environment and our community.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
        Our mission is to create a more sustainable and equitable food system by reducing food waste and providing access to nutritious food for those in need.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-7 mb-6">
        Share-A-Meal works by connecting local restaurants and grocery stores with nearby charities and food banks. When a restaurant or grocery store has excess food that would otherwise go to waste, they can use our platform to quickly and easily donate it to a local charity or food bank. Charities and food banks can then distribute the donated food to those in need.

We are proud to have partnered with over 100 local restaurants and grocery stores, and to have donated over 50,000 pounds of food to local charities and food banks.
